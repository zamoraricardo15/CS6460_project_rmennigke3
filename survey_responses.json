","It can help.

I do NOT think this should ever be the focus but including little tidbits is nice","It can as long as the learning isn't enquiry based where students have to \"rediscover\" methods, algorithms, theories, etc... that these famous figures in STEM previously did. It detracts from the learning as I find telling students directly how to do certain things is better than letting them struggle over it.","If students pay attention, storytelling can be a memorable way for them to retain information.

This is especially important for STEM because it is often presented as ahistorical, but really, ideas and advances are deeply tied to the times that they are developed. The social context of STEM is more important than ever; we as technologists have a duty to consider the impact of our ideas on the world, and history can help provide that.","It will provide context for students and help them understand various approaches and lines of reasoning.
